# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator
For this webpage I used javascript to create a random password generator that randomly creates a password between 8-129 characters, using at least one selector (numbers, uppercase, lowercase, and symbols). The CSS and HTML were provided for me from Trilogy Education Services.
